# Classification of Healthcare Institutions

## **Categorisation of Health Care Institutions  for Covid Response Plan \(Ernakulam District\)** 

**Background:** The healthcare institutions which respond to the Covid Emergency have been classified into three plans. \(Plan A, B and C\).

**CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS**

Healthcare Institutions in the district are classified into three Plans.  
  
This classification is based on whether the institution falls under Government or Private sector and also considering the capacity and facilities available at the institution  
  
**1. Plan A Institutions :** Institutions under this plan are for providing healthcare services for two types of patients  
  
**** a. All patients who are covid positive  
 b. All patients who are covid suspects needing ICU and Critical Care Support

  
**2. Plan B Institutions :** Institutions under this plan are for providing healthcare services for two types of patients

**a.** All patients who fall under patient category \(A\) who do not have facilities for home isolation.

b. All patients who fall under patient category \(B\)

Plan B institutions are government sector healthcare institutions which have facilities for Isolation and Basic Treatment of Covid suspect patients.

**3. Plan C Institutions :** Healthcare Institutions in the private sector who have facilities for treating Covid positive and Covid suspect patients fall under this category.  
  
The services of Plan C institutions will be utilised under the following scenarios.  
  
 A. When government facilities \(Category A and Category B\) are overburdened.

 ****B. Covid Positive or Covid Suspect patients who seek treatment at private healthcare institutions and want to continue treatment there itself.

C. Patients in Government sector healthcare institutions who wish to transfer themselves to private healthcare institutions.

### **The Health Department of Ernakulam District has clinically categorised patients in three categories \(Category A, B and C\).**
