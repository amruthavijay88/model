# Hygiene Management

## **Medical Waste Disposal**

We need to connect to the IMA. 

* Medical waste - IMAGE, through IMA
* Food waste-  The cleaning staff to handle it by having deep burial in the campus itself.
* Plastics- segregated and dealt with by the _kudumbashree_ units
* Other waste- incinerator  


  We need to have four Large Bins at each Center for Medical Waste Disposal

## Clothes Management

Clothes are first dis-infected and washed.   
There are four large bins that are required for keeping used clothes.  
These would be then transported to a central facility for washing.
