# Load Balancing Corona Patients against healthcare facilities in a District

**Background:  
  
1**. Every district will need a plan to deal with individuals who are coming into a district after the lockdown is eased. This includes international, inter-state and inter district travellers.  
  
2. **Key Principle**: We have a separate system to deal with Covid patients and non covid patients.  


3. The following infrastructure facilities are required.
