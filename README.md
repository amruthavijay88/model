# Corona Care Center

## Why do we need a CCC?

India has a hospital capacity of 650,000 hospital beds. Out that Kerala has a capacity of 100,000 beds. However, the problem is that approximately 90% of it would be occupied.   
  
Thus, if the pandemic spreads rapidly through the population and people rush to the hospital for treatment, it will burden the healthcare system under a load that it cannot handle.  
  
The CCC is a public-private partnership system being created to soften the impact on Hospitals and for everyone who is affected to co-ordinate on how to approach the pandemic so that the maximum possible healthcare is being given without the system collapsing completely leading the maximum lives being saved.

## What is a CCC? 

A Corona Care Center is a temporary facility created to augment the healthcare system of the state and country in anticipation to a wide-spread pandemic.   
  
This is created by converting Educational Institutions like Schools and Colleges into centers where patients in the locality can reach out for help.
