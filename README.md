# Goal and Strategy

## I. War against Corona - The Kerala Model

The Goal for each citizen of the world living in the state of Kerala is to prevent the healthcare system from collapsing.

### II. Two step strategy:

### Step \#1. Corona Literacy Mission: WHO has brilliant content but in english.

We are translating this entire knowledge from WHO into Malayalam on Gitbook unlike the official site of Department of Health Services which has PDF's and not easy for the lay internet user. \([http://dhs.kerala.gov.in/](http://dhs.kerala.gov.in/)\)

[https://ml.coronasafe.in/](https://ml.coronasafe.in/) : Working is going on in parallel by small army of volunteers to translate content into something that every Malayalee can send in whatsapp. Critically, it will have a section for preventing fake news/myths as well.

Once citizens learn, there is a quiz for citizens to take and ensure that each one has the required knowledge. This is also bring translated into Malayalam.

#### Work in Progress: [https://quiz.coronasafe.in/](https://quiz.coronasafe.in/)

### Step\#2: Corona Care Center Network: A full network of temporary facilities that are setup to augment the capacity of the healthcare system are called Corona Care Centers.\(CCC\)

a. People who fall sick will go to the center first where they can get quarantined/be treated for mild illnesses.

b. People who fall critical will be transported by State wide Ambulance Network to nearest hospital which has the capacity.

#### III. We are now gathered preliminary requirements for creating a model CCC and plan to test this is one school \([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola\_School,\_Thiruvananthapuram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_School,_Thiruvananthapuram)\) and test the full physical + software system.

### IV. Once the software system is live - it will have features for

#### A. Individual Corona Care Center

Capacity Modelling -&gt; Organisation Structure -&gt; Volunteer Registration-&gt; Patient Management -&gt; Waste Management

#### B. Centralised Reporting and Dashboards for

Technology Development -&gt; Training of Volunteers-&gt; Inventory Supplies-&gt; Ambulance Network -&gt; Centralised Waste Disposal

## VI. Offensive Strategy:

#### Once the vaccine has been developed by scientists in parallel, our war strategy moves into offensive gear where we fight out the vaccine with active Corona Virus immunisation programmes.

We dont know the exact time estimate for this and estimates range from 6 months - 18 months \(Sept 2020 to Sept 2021\) so we need to plan ahead to ensure the self, family, state and nation is safe.
