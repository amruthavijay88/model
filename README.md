# Corona Care Center

## Why do we need a CCC?

India has a hospital capacity of 650,000 hospital beds. Out that Kerala has a capacity of 100,000 beds. However, the problem is that approximately 90% of it would be occupied.   
  
Thus, if the pandemic spreads rapidly through the population and people rush to the hospital for treatment, it will burden the healthcare system under a load that it cannot handle.  
  
The CCC is a system being created to soften the impact on Hospitals and for everyone who is affected to co-ordinate on how to approach the pandemic so that the maximum possible healthcare is being given without the system collapsing completely leading the maximum lives being saved.

## What is a CCC? 

A Corona Care Center is a temporary facility created to augment the healthcare system of the state and country in anticipation to a wide-spread pandemic.   
  
This is created by converting Educational Institutions like Schools and Colleges into centers where patients in the locality can reach out for help.  
  


## How does a CCC function?

There are two primary areas of a CCC.  
  
a.  ****Quarantine Area - People who are  exposed to Coronavirus but not contracted the disease yet are made to sit here for two week and to observe if they develop the disease.  
  
b. Primary Care Area - This is the Area where mild cases are treated.
