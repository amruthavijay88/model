# Waste Management

## **Medical Waste Disposal**

We need to connect to the IMA. 

* Medical waste - IMAGE, thru IMA
* Food waste- use the services of the councillor/ panchayat member to get the _kudumbashree_ units to handle it
* Plastics- segregated and dealt with by the _kudumbashree_ units
* Other waste- incinerator  We need to follow the process given by IMA and then IMA will collect the waste from the CCC daily.

## General Waste

Food waste and non food waste has to be separated and collected.
