# Patient Management

1. A patient who physically comes to the CCC first comes to the Registration Desk.  
2. From there the following details have to be collected and added to a centralised Patient Registry. 
3. This patient registry should collect the following details either by Patient Self Registration or Assisted Registration.

Name, Age, Sex, Aadhar Number, Mobile Number.  
Known contacts with Patient with Corona virus \(Yes/No\)  
If Yes - Details  
Significant Medical History  
Are you suffering from any chronic diseases like Diabetes \(Sugar\), Hypertension, Kidney or Heart diseases. If yes, what are the medicines that you are currently taking.  
  
4. Once Registration is over a decision should be taken by the doctor on the severity of the condition of the person and then decided as to

1. Send the person back home
2. Admit the person into the CCC 
3. Transfer to a Hospital

If the person is admitted to the CCC then the system has to say which class/building has the available bed for the person. \(desirable\).

A facility to update this Patient Record Daily needs to be there so that there is track of medical history. 

5. Each person will get an ID tag/ band to identify an inmate Directed to their allotted bed.

6.  A paper file is created to chart their stay- vital recordings and details of medications entered.The following parameters are to be monitored every six hours.

1. Fever
2. Cough and Breathing difficulty
3. Any other illness \(status of diabetes/hypertension\) 

7. This data is updated into the system by the data team and will be provided access to [software engineers to create predicitive data models on which patient could get critical.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/03/13/coronavirus-how-artificial-intelligence-data-science-and-technology-is-used-to-fight-the-pandemic/#7d84ce485f5f)

8. This data will be send to the hospital \(if a patient is being transferred\)/health department so that they have a comprehensive overview of the status of each patient and overall data in the CCC Network.  
  
9. Thus, when the doctors are already aware of the 7-14 day history and background details of the patient who is reaching saving time and energy.

**Patient Handover/Discharge- As soon as patient exits the system by two options which are \(A-\) Transfer to hospital or \(B\)- Discharged Home**   
  
The system has to thus capture the capacity utilisation of the center and the class/building wise utilisation as well.

## Other Details

1. Separate area for females to be created by the use of screens. 
2. No bystanders to be allowed. 
3. We have to also  consider entertainment- since the school auditorium has a projector. 
4. The rooms behind the stage will be for the staff.
5.  We need a realtime dashboard which shows the live data.
6. There should be a facility to assign patients separately as male and female+children and family \(father+mother+children+grant parents\) 

**Criteria for Discharge or Transfer to Hospital**

**&lt;Ramettan to add based on WHO/Health Department Guidelines&gt;**
