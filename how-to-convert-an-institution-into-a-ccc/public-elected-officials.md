  of the Centers.

# Public Elected Officials

* to include the ward councillor/ panchayat member in the plan
* use the services of local youth as support staff- they would be able to handle any unruly behaviour far better than us. Also, goodwill of the locals is essential for success.
* collection centres at/ near the venue for materials required may be considered
* to consider running the plan and inventory with someone who has experience in running a crisis centre during the floods
* to consider having a dry run before throwing it open.
