The procedure for the Airport screening have to be made into a final draft and then communicated to the CIAL and APHO for their information. The communication to the CIAL or APHO can only be done by the District Administration. 

Subsequently Mock drill for the same plan has to be conducted. 

The Health officials \(DMO or DPM\) should submit the proposed Airport screening operation plan to the District Collector. Once the same has been communicated the information would be given to the CIAL. 

Since, Airport is a highly sensitive organisation involving multiple agencies, it has to be done only after formal communications.
