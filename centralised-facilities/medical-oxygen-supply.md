# Medical Oxygen Supply

## BPCL is figuring out a way to ensure supply of oxygen through its partners. 

1. Capacity planning for Oxygen.
2. Oxygen through mask/tube or ventilator we need oxygen
3. 5 litres per minute per minute 300liters per hour \* 24 is 7200 Litres/day/person.
4. What is the litres of medical oxygen we can create?
5. Oxygen cylinder manufactures should function round the clock.
6. We need to ensure that their supply chain and distribution is working round the clock.

This is still work in progress.
