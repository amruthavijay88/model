# Inventory Supplies

There has to be features where government/volunteers are able to see the status and bring required material to each center.  
  
People following the CCC \(lets say in the Alumni Network\) should get real-time updates of the inventory on email/whatsapp/sms/website so that they can ensure the center is fully stocked up.  
  
There are two types of inventories which are to be present at the CCC.
