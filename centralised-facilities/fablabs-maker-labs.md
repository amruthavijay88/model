# SuperFab Labs

We are planning to make things that are critical yet but short supply in the global market. We are not sure the actual equipments that will be required but we are preparing ourselves as a team to work quickly and deliver products that we feel would be required.  
  
Since we havent worked before in a Global Pandemic situation and the situation is changing day by day, we have taken a decision at this point to prepare our team members to work jointly and finding the right roles and responsibilities that will enable us to make prototypes rapidly when the actual demands comes in from the healthcare system.  
  
To enable this, we are working on two key items that we anticipate a shortage for.  
  
**1. Mechanical Respirators**  
  
A mechanical respirator 

**2. N95 Masks  
  
We are now trying to create a prototype modelling with limited resources**
