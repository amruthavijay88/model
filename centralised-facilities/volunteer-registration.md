# Volunteer Registration

Priority in Registration will be given to volunteers who have contracted the diseases and have recovered fully.  
  
Such people should be part of the volunteer force as they are immune and can move around without any precautions amongst the infected and can handle it much better than anyone who has not yet contracted the disease. Thus, things like Masks and Hand Sanitisers are not majorly required.  
  
  
We should plan for volunteers to work in a one week cycle and one week off model. There needs to be a system where volunteers can register - work - exit - reregister.
