# Resource Mobilisation

**There are two separate verticals under which we are trying to mobilise resources.**  
  
1. Focussing on Domestic across India  
2. Focussing on Overseas/International   
  
**\#Priorities:**  
  
\#1.We need to quickly get connected to know people who are Trustees in Educational Institutions so that the Corona Care Centers can be setup.  
  
\#2.Financial Resources to mobilise Material Resources  
  
\#3. Material Resources for those who have access to what is required to setup a Model CCC.
