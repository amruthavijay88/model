# Covid 19 Spread Modelling

**Goal:**Our goals are 

.

* [ ] We need to predict when the hospital ICU capacity in the state will be breached.



* [ ] We need first to create prediction models with Data Scientists
* [ ] We need to issue call for Data Scientists
* [ ] Then we need to identify appropriate data and collate to fit the model
* [ ] Apply this to a spatial data set and build scenarios
