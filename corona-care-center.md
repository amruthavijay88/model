# Augmenting Capacity - Corona Care Centers

## Why do we need a CCC?

The total hospital bed capacity of a district is fixed. For Ernakulam the live data is here.  
  
Thus, if the pandemic spreads rapidly through the population and people rush to the hospital for treatment, it will burden the healthcare system under a load that it cannot handle.

## What is a CCC? 

A Corona Care Center is a temporary facility created to augment the healthcare system.  
  
This facility is created by converting Educational Institutions like School, Colleges, Panchayat Community Halls etc into centers where patients in the locality can reach out for help.  


## **Ernakulam Model CCC**

**Background:**  
  
1. There are 82 gram panchayats, 13 Municipalities and 1 Corporation in Ernakulam District.  
  
2. For managing Corona suspect and Corona positive patients, Corona Care facilities will be setup at panchayat/municipality level under the leadership of PHC/LSG Leadership

3. The Medical/Clinical Leadership of the CCC is by Medical Officer of PHC

4. The Community Leadership is responsible by LSG President and Secretary

5. The CCC will also take support from the Police Department and Revenue Department \(Village Officer\) within the Panchayat.

6. We need to set up 1 Model CCC in a panchayat initially. Then based on requirements, we scale up the model quickly.  


**At each CCC, there needs to be three main and separate facilities to be setup**  


1. **Testing Facility for taking Swab**  This is is for taking swab from patients who are corona suspects. 
2. **Facility for Caring for Positive Asymptomatic Patients**   These patients don't need much medical help for Corona. They need to be given food, recreation and other general medicines which they have been taking \(if any\).  There will be a medical nurse at the center to whom patients can report if they have any medical problems/difficulty.  Swabs collected will be taken to the centralised testing center which will be one testing center for 3-4 panchayats. 
3. **Facility for Caring for Positive Symptomatic Patients \(Fever/Cough/Throat Pain/Runny Nose\).**   These patients are also in cohorts/groups. The main difference in treatment of this facility is that medical help has to be higher. There needs to be 24 hours doctors/nurses at the facility who are working in three shifts.

We need to develop a clinical management protocol to take care of these patients.  
  
Every bed should have Stand for giving IV Fluids, Shelf and Medicines for symptomatic treatment \( Cough, Runny nose, throat pain\) and Pulse Oximeter for measuring oxygen saturation level.  
  
A center which has 30 beds should have 2 pulse oximeters ideally \(one as main and one as backup in case the first fails\)  
  
If the patient oxygen level Oxygen Saturation level falls below a threshold, then the the patient should be transferred via Ambulance to the next level Corona Treatment center.  
  
We need to keep one ambulance at each facility.  
  
Swabs collected will be taken to the centralised testing center which will be one testing center for 3-4 panchayats.  
  
-  
  
For the corporation with 600,000 citizens, the model is based on a  need 600,000/30,000 -&gt; 20 Panchayats.  
  


Organisation Structure \(Team\)  
  
Panchayat Secretary has the charge of the Corona Care Center  
  
1 Modern medicine doctors from PHC

Ayurveda doctors

Homeo Doctors  
Volunteer doctors in the panchayat  
  
1 nurse from PHC

Volunteer nurses in the panchat  
  
Volunteer Pharmacists in the panchayat

  
  
Centralised Training  
  
At each panchayat, we can train modern medicine, ayurveda and homeo doctors and other nurses to ensure that the clinical management protocols are maintained in the three facilities.

  
Training will be on  
  
1. How to take Swap  
2. How to treat Asymptomatic

3. How to treat Symptomatic patients  
  
We need to just train the team on the protocols.  


Inventory Ready  
  
1. Bed and Mattress at 1M distance

  
3. Small Shelf to keep personal items  
4. Phone Charging Facility

5. Books / TV  
6. Music  
7. Water / Food  
  


Waste Management System :  
  
  
Medical Waste - IMA

Food Waste - Deep burial in a location at the panchayat

  
Clothes Management

Clothes are first dis-infected, washed and ironed. \(central facility\).

  
Dress Changing has to be thought out.  
Bathroom \(either at the community halls\) or Bio- Toilets  
--  
  


We keep the short stay homes ready and different from CCCâ€™s.  
  
Short Stay Homes - We cannot keep symptomatic patients here. These rooms are not visible. People who worsen can worsen quickly and thus the doctor/nurse should be able to watch.  
  
This is for people who need isolation.
